## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Plugin scaffold and manifest.
- `commit-message` skill: drafts a Simplified Chinese Conventional Commits message from the actual Git changes without any authorship trailers, asks before including files that Claude did not edit in the session, then keeps the message, commits, or commits and pushes as requested.
- `repo-init` skill: initializes a Git repository with fully commented `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, and `.gitattributes` files based on the detected stack, and asks for confirmation of the tracked files.
